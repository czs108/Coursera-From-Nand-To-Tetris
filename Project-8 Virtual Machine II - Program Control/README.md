# Virtual Machine II - Program Control

https://www.nand2tetris.org/project08

------

## Background

We continue building the VM translator - a program that translates programs written in the VM language into programs written in the *Hack* machine language. This is a respectable chunk of engineering, so we are doing it in two stages. Welcome to *Stage II*.

## Objective

Extend the basic VM translator built in *Project 7* into a full-scale VM translator. In particular, in *Project 7* we focused on handling the stack arithmetic and memory access commands of the VM language. We now turn to handle the VM language's branching and function calling commands.

## Contract

Write a full-scale *VM-to-Hack* translator, extending the basic translator developed in *Project 7*, and conforming to the *VM Specification, Part II* (book *Section 8.2*) and to the *Standard VM-on-Hack Mapping, Part II* (book *Section 8.3.1*). Use your VM translator to translate the VM programs supplied below, yielding corresponding programs written in the *Hack* assembly language. When executed on the supplied *CPU Emulator*, the translated code generated by your VM translator should deliver the results mandated by the test scripts and compare files supplied below.

Note that a VM program may span either a single `.vm` file or a directory containing one or more `.vm` files. In the former case, the VM translator is invoked using the command `VMTranslator fileName.vm`. The translator creates an output file named `fileName.asm`, which is stored in the same directory of the input file. In the latter case, the VM translator is invoked using `VMTranslator dirName`. The translator creates a single output file named `dirName.asm`, which is stored in the same directory. This single file contains the assembly code resulting from translating all the `.vm` files in the input directory. The name of the input file or directory may contain a file path. If no path is specified, the VM translator operates on the current directory by default.

## Resources

The relevant reading for this project is *Chapter 8*. You will need two tools: the programming language with which you will implement your VM translator, and the supplied *CPU Emulator*. This emulator allows executing, and testing, on your PC, the machine code generated by your VM translator. Another tool that comes handy in this project is the supplied *VM Emulator*. The *VM Emulator* (described at the bottom of this page) allows experimenting with the supplied VM programs before setting out to write your VM translator.

## Testing

We recommend completing the implementation of the VM translator in two stages:

1. Implement and test the translation of the VM language's branching commands.
2. Implement and test the translation of the function call and return commands. This will allow you to unit-test your implementation incrementally, using the test programs supplied below.

**Testing how the VM translator handles branching commands:**

|       Program        |                         Description                          |                         Test Scripts                         |
| :------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|    `BasicLoop.vm`    | Computes the sum 1+2+...+ n and pushes the result onto the stack. This program tests the implementation of the VM language's branching commands `goto` and `if-goto`. |   `BasicLoopVME.tst`<br>`BasicLoop.tst`<br>`BasicLoop.cmp`   |
| `FibonacciSeries.vm` | Computes and stores in memory the first *n* elements of the *Fibonacci* series. This typical array manipulation program provides a more challenging test of the VM's branching commands. | `FibonacciSeriesVME.tst`<br>`FibonacciSeries.tst`<br>`FibonacciSeries.cmp` |

**Testing how the VM translator handles function call and return commands:**

- `SimpleFunction.vm`

  - **Description**

    Performs a simple calculation and returns the result. This program provides a basic test of the implementation of the VM commands function and return.

  - **Test Scripts**

    `SimpleFunctionVME.tst`

    `SimpleFunction.tst`

    `SimpleFunction.cmp`

- `NestedCall/Sys.vm`

  An optional and intermediate test, which may be useful when `SimpleFunction` (the previous test) passes but `FibonacciElement` (the next test) fails.

  - **Description**

    Tests several requirements of the function calling protocol.

    For more information about this optional test, see `NestedCall.html` and `NestedCallStack.html`.

    Can be used with or without the VM bootstrap code.

  - **Test Scripts**

    `NestedCallVME.tst`
    `NestedCall.tst`
    `NestedCall.cmp`

- `FibonacciElement/Main.vm` & `FibonacciElement/Sys.vm`

  Since the program consists of more than one `.vm` file, the entire directory must be translated.

  The translation should yield a single assembly file named `FibonacciElement.asm`.

  See the note below for more information on handling multiple `.vm` files.
  - **Description**

    Tests the handling of the VM's function calling commands, the bootstrap section, and most of the other VM commands. The program directory consists of two files, as follows.

    - `Main.vm` contains one function named `Main.fibonacci`. This recursive function returns the *n*th element of the *Fibonacci* series, and is unrelated to the *Fibonacci* series program described previously in this project.

    - `Sys.vm` contains a single function named `Sys.init`. This function calls the `Main.fibonacci` function with *n* = 4, and then loops indefinitely (the `Sys.init` function, in turn, will be called by the VM implementation's bootstrap code).

  - **Test Scripts**

    `FibonacciElementVME.tst`

    `FibonacciElement.tst`

    `FibonacciElement.cmp`

    Unlike the previous tests, this test assumes that the VM translator initializes the VM implementation.

    If the generated assembly file will not begin with bootstrap code, the test will fail.

- `StaticsTest/Class1.vm`, `StaticsTest/Class2.vm` & `StaticsTest/Sys.vm`

  - **Description**

    - `Class1.vm` and `Class2.vm` contain VM functions designed to set and get various static values; this is done in order to test the handling of the static memory segment.

    - `Sys.vm` contains a single `Sys.init` function that calls the `get` / `set` functions of `Class1` and `Class2`.

  - **Test Scripts**

    `StaticsTestVME.tst`
    `StaticsTest.tst`
    `StaticsTest.cmp`

    This test assumes that the VM translator initializes the VM implementation; if the generated assembly file will not begin with bootstrap code, the test will fail.

## Proposed Implementation

For each one of the five test programs, follow these steps:

1. To get acquainted with the intended behavior of the supplied test program `Xxx.vm`, run it on the supplied *VM Emulator* using the supplied `XxxVME.tst` script (if the program consists of one ore more files residing in a directory, load the entire directory into the *VM Emulator* and proceed to execute the code).
2. Use your VM translator to translate the supplied `Xxx.vm` file, or directory, as needed. The result should be a new text file containing *Hack* assembly code. The name of this file should be `Xxx.asm`.
3. Inspect the translated `Xxx.asm` program. If there are visible syntax (or any other) errors, debug and fix your VM translator.
4. To check if the translated code performs properly, use the supplied `Xxx.tst` and `Xxx.cmp` files to run the translated `Xxx.asm` program on the supplied *CPU Emulator*. If there are any problems, debug and fix your VM translator.

**API:** *Chapter 8* includes a proposed, language-independent VM translator API. This API can serve as your implementation's blueprint.

**Implementation order:** The supplied test programs were carefully planned to test the incremental features introduced by each stage in your VM implementation. Therefore, it's important to implement your VM translator in the proposed order, and to test it using the supplied test programs at each stage. Implementing a later stage before an early one may cause the test programs to fail.

**Initialization:** In order for the translated VM code to execute on the host computer platform, the translated code stream (written in the machine language of the host platform) must include some bootstrap code that maps the stack on the host RAM and starts executing the code proper. The first three test programs in this project assume that the bootstrap code was not yet implemented, and include test scripts that effect the necessary initializations (as was done in *Project 7*). The last two test programs assume that the bootstrap code is generated by the VM translator. In other words, the assembly code that the final version of your VM translator generates must start with some code that sets the stack pointer and calls the `Sys.init` function. `Sys.init` will then call the `Main.main` function, and the program will start running (similar to how Java's JVM always looks for, and starts executing, a method named `main`).

## Tools

Before setting out to develop your VM translator, we recommend getting acquainted with the virtual machine architecture model and language. As mentioned above, this can be done by running, and experimenting with, the supplied `.vm` test programs using the supplied *VM Emulator*.

**The VM Emulator:** This Java program, located in your `nand2tetris/tools` directory, is designed to execute VM programs in a direct and visual way, without having to first translate them into machine language. For example, you can use the supplied *VM Emulator* to see - literally speaking - how `push` and `pop` commands effect the stack. And, you can use the simulator to execute any one of the supplied `.vm` test programs.

For more information, see the *VM Emulator Tutorial*.
